# Species-Concentration-vs-pH
To generate plots for log-species concentration vs pH graphs for acid-base chemistry (for mono-, di-, and triprotic acids).

This notebook calculates species concentration exactly, without the need for simple algebraic approximations. It will also calculate the pH of a solution given the concentrations of acid and base added.

Remember to press shift-enter to run the Mathematica notebooks.
